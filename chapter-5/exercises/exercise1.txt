The following program fragments illustrate the relational and equality operators.
Show the output produced by each, assuming that i, j and k are int variables.

(a) i = 2; j = 3;
    k = i * j == 6;
    printf("%d", k);
Output: 1

(b) i = 5; j = 10; k = 1;
    printf("%d", k > i < j);
Output: 1

(c) i = 3; j = 2; k = 1;
    printf("%d", i < j == j < k);
Output: 0

(d) i = 3; j = 4; k = 5;
    printf("%d", i % j + i < k);
Output: 0
