Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

(a) for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
(b) for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
(c) for (i = 0; i++ < 10; )

Option c is not equivalent because i++ is being incremented in the initial check to see if the loop should run, so 0 will not print.
