Which one of t he following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming the loop bodies are the same)?

(a) while (i < 10)
(b) for (; i < 10;)
(c) do {} while (i < 10);

Option c is not equivalent, because it will always loop through the body at least once, so if the initial value is already > 10 it will execute at least once.
