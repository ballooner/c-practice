The following function is supposed to compute the sum and average
of the numbers in the array a, which has length n. avg and sum point to
variables that the function should modify. Unfortunately, the function contains
several errors; find and correct them.

void avg_sum(double a[], int n, double *avg, double *sum)
{
    int i;

    sum = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        sum += a[i];
    avg = sum / n;
}

Errors:
1. (sum = 0.0;) should be (*sum = 0.0;)
2. (sum += a[i];) should be (*sum += a[i];)
3. (avg = sum / n;) should be (*avg = *sum / n;)
