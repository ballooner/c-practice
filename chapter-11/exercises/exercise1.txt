If i is a variable and p points to i, which of the following expressions
are aliases for i?

(a) *p
    Not an alias as it represents the value of i.
(b) &p
    Not an alias as it represents the address of p.
(c) *&p
    This is an alias of i. &p gets the address that the pointer p is stored in
    and then using * on &p will get the value that is stored in that address.
(d) &*p
    This is an alias of i. *p gets the value of the address that p points to
    and then using & on *p will get the address of the value.
(e) *i
    This isn't an alias and also won't work.
(f) &i
    This is an alias for i as it gets the address that i is stored in.
(g) *&i
    This isn't an alias, it just does the same thing as typing 'i'.
(h) &*i
    This also doesn't work because *i isn't valid.
