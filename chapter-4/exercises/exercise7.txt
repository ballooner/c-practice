The algorithm for computing the UPC check digit ends with the following steps:
    Subtract 1 from the total
    Compute the remainder when the adjusted total is divided by 10
    Subtract the remainder from 9
It's tempting to try to simplify the algorithm by using these steps instead:
    Compute the remainder when the total is divided by 10
    Subtract the remainder from 10
Why doesn't this technique work?

This technique doesn't work because when the total starts at a number that can be evenly divided by 10 the result will be 0 for the first case and 10 for the second.
