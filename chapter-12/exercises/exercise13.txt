Section 8.2 had a program fragment in which two nested for loops initialized
the array ident for use as an identity matrix. Rewrite this code using a single
pointer to step through the array one element at a time. 

#define N 10


void init_ident(int n, double ident[n][n])
{
    int zeros = 0;
    double *p = &ident[0][0];
    *p = 1;

    while (p++ < &ident[0][0] + n * n)
    {
     if (zeros == n)
     {
         *p = 1;
         zeros = 0;
     } else 
     {
         *p = 0;
         zeros++;
     }
    }
}
