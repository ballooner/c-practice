Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable.
Assuming that the assignment p = a has just been performed, which of the
following expressions are illegal because of mismatched types? Of the remaining
expressions, which are true (have a nonzero value)?

(a) p == a[0]
    Illegal 
(b) p == &a[0]
    Legal & True
(c) *p == a[0]
    Legal & True
(d) p[0] == a[0]
    Legal & True
