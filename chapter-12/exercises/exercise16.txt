Write a loop that prints the highest temperature in the temperatures array
(see Exercise 14) for each day of the week. The loop body should call the 
find_largest function, passing it one row of the array at a time.

for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
{
    printf("%d ", find_largest(temperature[i], 24));
}
