Rewrite the following function to use pointer arithmetic instead of array
subscripting. (In other words, eliminate the variabels i and all uses of 
the [] operator.) Make as few changes as possible.

int sum_array(const int a[], int n)
{
    int sum;

    sum = 0;
    for (int *p = &a[0]; p < &a[n]; p++)
        sum += *p;
    return sum;
}
