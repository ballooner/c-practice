The Q&A section shows how to use a letter as an array subscript. Describe how to use a digit (in character form) as a subscript.

All you would have to do was subtract the value of '0' to access the corresponding array indexes properly.

For example:
char num = '5';
array['5' - '0'] = 0;

Would set the array's fifth element (fourth index) to 0.
