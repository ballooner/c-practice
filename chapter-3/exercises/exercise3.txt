For each of the following pairs of scanf format strings, indicate wheter or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they can be distinguished.

(a) "%d"       versus " %d"
    Equivalent
(b) "%d-%d-%d" versus "%d -%d -%d"
    The first format expects the '-' right after it reads the last number so if "-10 -2" is entered it will fail to match it and put the -2 in the buffer to
    be read by the next scanf.
    The second format expects there to be at least one character of whitespace after the last character it reads, therefore it should work in the previous case.
(c) "%f"       versus "%f "
    The first statement will accept the number entered after hitting enter while the second statement will hang until a non-whitespace character is entered after
    the first number is input.
(d) "%f,%f"    versus "%f, %f"
    Equivalent
