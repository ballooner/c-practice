The square2.c program of Section 6.3 will fail (usually by printing strange answers) if i * i axceeds the max int value.
Run the program and determine the smallest value of n that causes failure. Try changing the type of i to short and running again.
Then try long. From these experiments, what can you conclude about the number of bits used to store integer types on your machine.

Short's take up 2 bytes, ints 4 bytes and longs take 8 bytes.
