Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of f correctly (assuming that f and frac_part are float variables)?

frac_part = f - (int) f;

It will only compute the fractional part correctly assuming the non-fractional part is within the range storeable in an int. 
Otherwise overflow will occur when converting f to an int.
